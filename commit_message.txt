feat: Refactor settings UI and add System Prompt for LLM

Refactors the settings panel UI:
- Splits the "AI and Advanced Settings" tab into two separate tabs: "AI Settings" and "Advanced Settings".
- Moves "Intelligent Timeline Adjustment" controls to the "Advanced Settings" tab.
- Adds a multi-line text input for "System Prompt" in the "AI Settings" tab, allowing users to provide custom context for LLM enhancement.

Updates related logic:
- Modifies SettingsPanel, MainWindow, WorkflowManager, and LLMEnhancer to handle the new UI structure and pass the system_prompt to the LLM.
- The LLMEnhancer now prioritizes the user-defined system_prompt. If script_context is also provided, it's prepended to the system_prompt (either user-defined or default).
- Updates DEVELOPMENT.md to reflect these UI and functionality changes.
