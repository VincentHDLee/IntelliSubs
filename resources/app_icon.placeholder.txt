Placeholder for app_icon.ico

This file indicates where the application icon (e.g., `app_icon.ico` for Windows)
should be placed.

The actual .ico file should be created using an icon editor and
referenced by the build script (e.g., scripts/build_app.py) when
packaging the application with PyInstaller or Nuitka.

Default name expected by build_app.py: app_icon.ico
Recommended size for .ico: Multi-resolution, including at least 256x256, 48x48, 32x32, 16x16.
